## (AI51020) Explainability in Machine Learning Course Contents

This course aims to understand the notion of interpretability and explainability of a machine learning model. The first part details different classes of interpretable models, such as prototype-based approaches, sparse linear models, rule-based techniques, generalized additive models, etc. Later, it discusses post-hoc explanations such as black-box explanations, counterfactual explanations, saliency maps, etc. Further, the course explores the connections between interpretability, causality, debugging, bias, and fairness. Throughout the course, there will be an emphasis on multiple applications, such as criminal justice, computer vision, healthcare, etc., that can immensely benefit from model interpretability. This course involves discussing seminal and recent work that is relevant in the form of student presentations and a semester-long project.
